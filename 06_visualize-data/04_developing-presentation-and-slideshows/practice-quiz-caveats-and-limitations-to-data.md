* **Colleague test**

> A colleague test is an effective way to anticipate questions a stakeholder might have during a Q&A.

* Analysis
* Presentation skills
* Data
* **Findings**

> This stakeholder is making an objection about your findings. 

&nbsp;

### Question 3

After your presentation, a stakeholder is concerned about whether your data comes from a reputable source. In what ways should you respond? Select all that apply.

* **Acknowledge that the objection is valid**
* **Follow up with details about the source**
* Question why the stakeholder is concerned
* **Take steps to investigate the source further**

> When you receive an objection with merit, the best way to respond is by acknowledging its validity. Then, follow up with details and promise to investigate the matter further.
