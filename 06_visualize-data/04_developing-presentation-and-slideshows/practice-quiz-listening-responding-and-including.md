## L5 Listen, respond and include

&nbsp;

### Question 1

After you finish giving a presentation, and an audience member asks your team about additional information on your topic. Your coworker is answering the question thoroughly, but you notice that the rest of your audience has tuned out. How can you re-engage your audience? Select all that apply.

* Repeat the question
* **Redirect to a new question**
* Interrupt your coworker
* **Ask a question to the audience**

> If you notice your audience is losing interest, you can redirect to a new question or ask a question to your audience to re-engage them.

&nbsp;

### Question 2

You answer a question from an audience member, who then seems confused. You conclude that you didnâ€™t understand the question. What should you have done differently to avoid the issue? Select all that apply.

* **Repeated the question to clarify**
* Elaborated more on the topic
* **Listened to the full question**
* Provided more context for their answer

> In this scenario, two actions could have assisted you in answering the question: listen to the full question or repeat the question to clarify. These strategies can help you answer a question directly and completely.

&nbsp;

### Question 3

Your audience has several questions after your presentation, and you may not have enough time to answer them all. How should you proceed?

* Involve the whole audience
* Repeat each question
* **Keep responses brief and follow up after the presentation**
* Understand the context of each question

> To answer more questions in less time, keep each response brief and to the point. This way, you answer a question directly and have more time to move onto the next one. After the Q&A, you can follow up with any questions that still need clarification.
