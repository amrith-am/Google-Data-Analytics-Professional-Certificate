## Scenario 1, questions 1-9

### Question 1

You have been working as a junior data analyst at Bowling Green Business Intelligence for nearly a year. Your supervisor, Kate, tells you that she believes you are ready for more responsibility. She asks you to lead an upcoming client presentation. You will be responsible for creating the data story, identifying the right tools to use, building the slideshow, and delivering the presentation to stakeholders.

Your client is Gaea, an automotive manufacturer that makes eco-friendly electric cars. For the past year, you have been working with the data team in Gaea’s Bowling Green, Kentucky, headquarters. For the presentation, you will engage the data team, as well as its regional sales representatives and distributors. Your presentation will inform their business strategy for the next three-to-five years.

You begin by getting together with your team to discuss the data story you want to tell. You know the first step in data storytelling is to engage your audience. 

**You use spotlighting to help you identify the most important insights. Which of the following activities are involved with spotlighting? Select all that apply.**

* **Noticing repeated words or numbers**
* **Identifying connections or patterns**
* Determining the data’s partiality
* **Finding ideas or concepts that keep arising** 

> Spotlighting enables data analysts to identify broad, universal ideas and messages. This may involve identifying connections or patterns, finding ideas or concepts that keep arising, or noticing repeated words or numbers.

&nbsp;

### Question 2

After you identify the most important insights, it’s time to create your primary message. Your team’s analysis has revealed three key insights:

1. Electric vehicle sales demand is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025.
2. The number of publicly available vehicle charging stations is a significant factor in consumer buying decisions. Currently, there are many locations with so few charging stations that electric car owners would run out of power when traveling between stations. 
3. Vehicle battery range is also a significant factor for consumers. In 2020, the average battery range was 210 miles. However, the vast majority of survey respondents report they will not buy an electric car until the battery range is at least 300 miles per charge.

**Based on these insights, you create your primary message. Which of the following reflect the expectations of a primary message?**

* The number of publicly available vehicle charging stations is a significant factor in consumer buying decisions. Therefore, Gaea must begin building vehicle charging stations
* Electric vehicle sales demand is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025. However, the number of publicly available vehicle charging stations is a significant factor in consumer buying decisions. Currently, there are many locations with so few charging stations that electric car owners would run out of power when traveling between stations. Vehicle battery range is also a significant factor for consumers. In 2020, the average battery range was 210 miles. However, the vast majority of people say they will not buy an electric car until the battery range is at least 300 miles per charge
* Electric vehicle demand is skyrocketing
* **Although electric vehicle sales demand is on the rise, low availability of charging stations and short battery range are significant hurdles that Gaea must overcome**

> A  primary message should be clear, direct, and succinct. Your primary message states: Although electric vehicle sales demand is on the rise, low availability of charging stations and short battery range are significant hurdles that Gaea must overcome. 

&nbsp;

### Question 3

Next, you decide on your data narrative’s characters, setting, plot, big reveal, and aha moment. The characters are the people affected by your story. This includes your stakeholders, Gaea’s customers, and Gaea’s potential future customers. For the setting, you describe the current situation, potential tasks, and background information about the analysis project.

**As you begin to work on the plot for the data narrative, which of the following ideas would you include? Select all that apply.**

* How your data analysis can help Gaea solve its business problems
* **The challenges associated with the current lack of vehicle charging stations**
* A list of your recommendations and details about why they will help Gaea be successful
* **Why it’s important for Gaea to increase its cars’ battery range by 2025**

> The plot, or conflict, is used to create tension in the data story. For Gaea’s situation, the plot would include two ideas: First, the plot should explain the challenges associated with lack of vehicle charging stations. Second, it should address why it’s important for Gaea to increase its cars’ battery range by 2025.

&nbsp;

### Question 4

Now, it’s time to consider which tools to use to create data visualizations that will clearly communicate the results of your analysis. You and your team decide to make both spreadsheet charts and Tableau data visualizations. In addition, you agree to build a dashboard to share live, incoming data with your stakeholders. This will help them achieve the following goals:

* Organize multiple datasets about electric vehicle battery ranges into a central location
* Enable tracking and analysis of electric vehicle data
* Simplify data visualizations about the number of available charging stations using maps of the different geographies 

**Another key benefit of dashboards is that they enable you to maintain control of your data narrative.**

* True
* **False**

> Sharing dashboards with stakeholders likely means that you will lose control of the narrative. This is because you won’t be there to tell the story of your data and share your key message. 

&nbsp;

### Question 5

Now that you have finished planning the data story with your team, it’s time to create data visualizations. First, you consider electric vehicle sales worldwide in 2015 compared to 2020. You use a spreadsheet to create the following bar graph to compare the two values:

![img](img/question05.png)

**You add information on the x-axis to represent a scale of values for the total electric vehicle sales and on the y-axis to represent the time periods (2015 and 2020).**

* True
* **False**

> In bar graphs with vertical bars, the x-axis is used to represent time periods, categories, or other variables. The y-axis is used to represent a scale of values for the variables. 

&nbsp;

### Question 6

Next, you explore how access to public car-charging stations is influencing electric vehicle purchases. As your analysis has revealed, there are many areas without enough places for people to plug in and charge their cars. This lack of charging stations has a negative impact on demand for electric cars and overall vehicle sales. 

You use Tableau to create the following draft of a visualization, which organizes the charging station data geographically: 

![img](img/question06.png)

After reviewing your draft, you realize that it could be improved. 

**Fill in the blank: To improve your draft, you select more varied hues and make the color intensity stronger. In addition, you choose darker _____ in order to reflect more light.**

* views
* variables
* visuals
* **values**

> Value indicates how much light is being reflected. 

&nbsp;

### Question 7

Now, you want to highlight what your team’s analysis discovered about the number of charging stations available compared to the number of cars purchased. Your data has confirmed that the lack of charging stations causes the effect of fewer car sales. To communicate this effectively, you will need to convey causation to the stakeholders.

**You explain that causation is the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other. In the case of Gaea’s business, charging station numbers and car sales move in the same direction.**

* True
* **False**

> You explain that causation is when an action directly leads to an outcome, such as a cause-effect relationship. In the case of Gaea’s business, the lack of charging stations directly leads to the outcome of fewer car sales.

&nbsp;

### Question 8

Once you finish creating data visualizations about the current state of the electric vehicle market, you turn to projections for the future. You want to communicate to stakeholders about the importance of longer vehicle battery range to consumers.

Your team’s data includes feedback from a consumer survey that investigated the importance of longer battery when choosing whether to purchase an electric car. The current average battery range is about 210 miles. By 2025, that distance is expected to grow to 450 miles per charge.

You create the following pie chart: 

![img](img/question08.png)

**Fill in the blank: After reviewing your pie chart, you realize that it could be improved. You resize the _____ so they visually show the different values.**

* axes
* **segments**
* labels
* values

> To make this chart more effective, you resize the segments so they visually show the different values. When the segments are all the same size, even though they represent different values, this will confuse the audience. 

&nbsp;

### Question 9

It’s time to build your Tableau dashboard for stakeholders. You consider what type of layout to use.

**Describe the differences between vertical and horizontal layouts. Select all that apply.**

* **Vertical layouts adjust the height of the views and objects contained**
* Vertical layouts prevent items from being layered over other objects
* **Horizontal layouts adjust the width of the views and objects contained**
* Horizontal layouts prevent items from being layered over other objects

> Vertical layouts adjust the height of the views and objects contained. Horizontal layouts adjust the width of the views and objects contained.

## Scenario 2, questions 10-15

### Question 10

You have created your narrative and visuals, so now it’s time to build a professional and appealing slideshow. You choose a theme that matches the tone of your presentation. Then, you create a title slide with a title, subtitle, and the date. 

Next, you create the following slide to communicate information about electric vehicle sales in 2015 compared to 2020: 

![img](img/question10.png)

**To improve the slide, you remove the text box at the bottom. For what reasons will this make your slide more effective? Select all that apply.**

* Slide text should be no more than 10 lines total
* **The text shouldn’t simply repeat the words you say**
* **The font size is too small for your audience to read**
* **Slide text should be fewer than 25 words total**

> Removing the text box at the bottom improves your slide in three ways: First, it eliminates text with a font size that is too small to read. Second, it reduces the slide’s word count to fewer than 25 words. Third, it ensures that the text does not simply repeat the words you say. 

&nbsp;

### Question 11

You then create the following slide to demonstrate the challenges associated with battery range and charging stations:

![img](img/question11.png)

After reviewing your slide, you realize that the visual elements could be improved. You do this by first choosing one data visualization to share on this slide, then create another slide for the second data visualization.

**In addition, you make sure to use _____ font sizes and colors for all of your data visualization titles.**

* colorful
* **consistent**
* different
* unique

> To make the visual elements more effective, you use a consistent font size and color for data visualization titles.

&nbsp;

### Question 12

You complete your slideshow and share it with your team. Once it is approved by your supervisor, you begin preparing to give your presentation. You consider maintaining good posture, being aware of nervous habits, and making eye contact. In addition, you think about how you will speak.

**What strategies can help you speak effectively? Select all that apply.**

* **Using short words and sentences**
* Speaking quickly so you are sure to have time to include all important data points
* **Building in intentional pauses to give your audience time to think about what you have just said**
* **Keeping the pitch of your sentences level so that your statements are not confused for questions**

> To speak effectively, you should practice using short words and sentences, keeping the pitch of your sentences level, and building in intentional pauses.

&nbsp;

### Question 13

Next, you prepare for the question-and-answer session that will follow your presentation. To predict what questions they may ask, you do a colleague test of your presentation. You should choose a colleague who has deep expertise in the electric vehicle industry.

* True
* **False**

> You choose a colleague who has no previous knowledge of the industry. This will help you confirm that you aren’t making any assumptions or including jargon your audience might not understand.

&nbsp;

### Question 14

Now that you have some idea of the questions the stakeholders will ask, you and a team member consider different objections that might arise. 

**Your team member asks you how you will respond if someone from Gaea questions your data-cleaning process. How do you prepare for this objection? Select all that apply.**

* Be prepared to explain why data cleaning is not relevant at this stage of the project
* **Keep a detailed log of your data-cleaning process**
* **Practice answering questions about your data-cleaning process**
* **Add your data-cleaning log to the slideshow appendix**

> You prepare by keeping a detailed log of your data-cleaning process. Then, you add your data-cleaning log to the slideshow appendix and practice answering questions about your data-cleaning process.

&nbsp;

### Question 15

Scenario 2, continued

As a final step in the data-sharing process, you think about how to respond during the Q&A session. What strategies will you employ when answering questions? Select all that apply.

* Provide detailed, comprehensive responses
* **Understand the context of the question**
* **Listen to the whole question, and repeat it, if necessary**
* Involve your whole audience

> When answering questions, you should listen to the whole question, and repeat it, if necessary. You should also be sure you understand the context of the question and involve the whole audience.
