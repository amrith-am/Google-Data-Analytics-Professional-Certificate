### Question 1

A data analyst wants to create a visualization that demonstrates how often data values fall into certain ranges. What type of data visualization should they use?

* Scatter plot
* **Histogram**
* Correlation chart
* Line graph

> To demonstrate how often data values fall into certain ranges, the data analyst should use a histogram.

&nbsp;

### Question 2

A data analyst notices that two variables in their data seem to rise and fall at the same time. They recognize that these variables are related somehow. What is this an example of?

* Causation
* Tabulation
* Visualization
* **Correlation**

> When a data analyst notices that two variables rise and fall at the same time, this is an example of correlation. Correlation is the measure of the degree to which two variables change in relationship to each other.

### Question 3

Fill in the blank: A data analyst creates a presentation for stakeholders. They include _____ visualizations because they want them to be interactive and automatically change over time.

* geometric
* aesthetic
* **dynamic**
* static

> They include dynamic visualizations. Dynamic visualizations are interactive and can automatically change over time.

* **Sophisticated use of contrast**
* **Refined execution**
* Visual form
* **Clear meaning**

> The elements for effective visualization are clear meaning, sophisticated use of contrast, and refined execution.

### Question 5

Fill in the blank: Design thinking is a process used to solve problems in a _____ way. 

* critical
* design-centric
* analytical
* **user-centric**

> Design thinking is a process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way.

### Question 6

You are in the ideate phase of the design process. What are you doing at this stage?

* **Generating visualization ideas**
* Sharing data visualizations with a test audience
* Making changes to their data visualization 
* Creating data visualizations

> There are five phases of the design process: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. The ideate phase is when you start to generate your data visualization ideas. 

&nbsp;

### Question 7

A data analyst wants to make their visualizations more accessible by adding text explanations directly on the visualization. What is this called? 

* **Labeling**
* Subtitling
* Simplifying 
* Distinguishing

> This is labeling. Labeling data directly instead of relying on legends can make data visualizations more accessible.

&nbsp;

### Question 8

Distinguishing elements of your data visualizations makes the content easier to see. This can help make them more accessible for audience members with visual impairments. What are some methods data analysts use to distinguish elements?

* Add a legend
* Ensure all elements are highlighted equally
* **Separate the foreground and background**
* Use contrasting colors and shapes 

> Data analysts distinguish elements of data visualizations by separating the foreground and background and using contrasting colors and shapes.
