### Question 1

You are working on a project related to rental properties in the United States. You write the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM rentals.us_housing_units
```

How can you instruct the database to retrieve only the first 10 results?

* RETRIEVE 10
* **LIMIT 10**
* RETURN 10
* FIRST 10

> To display only the first 10 results, you would type, LIMIT 10.

### Question 2

What function can be used to confirm that spreadsheet cell B8 contains exactly 20 characters?

* LEN = B8,20
* =LEN(20)
* LEN = B8
* **=LEN(B8)**

> The function =LEN(B8) will display the number of characters in cell B8. The LEN function returns the length of a string of text by counting the number of characters it contains.
