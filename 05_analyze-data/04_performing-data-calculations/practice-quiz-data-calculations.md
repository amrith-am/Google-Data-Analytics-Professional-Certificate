### Question 1

What is the correct spreadsheet formula for multiplying 50 and 233?

* 50x233
* =50x233
* **=50*233**

### Question 2

The following is a selection of a spreadsheet:

|    | A              | B       |
|----|----------------|---------|
| 1  | Expense        | Amount  |
| 2  | Rent           | $680.00 |
| 3  | Healthcare     | $101.00 |
| 4  | Groceries      | $185.00 |
| 5  | Clothing       | $41.00  |
| 6  | Transportation | $22.00  |
| 7  | Mobile phone   | $48.00  |
| 8  | Dining out     | $79.00  |
| 9  | Car insurance  | $65.00  |
| 10 | Dog walker     | $40.00  |
| 11 | Gym membership | $19.00  |
| 12 | Manicure       | $23.00  |

You are trying to determine what percentage of your monthly income is spent on big-ticket items, such as rent and groceries. To add together only the values from Column B that cost more than $150, what is the correct syntax?

* =SUMIF(B2:B12,"<150")
* =SUMIF(B2:B12,>150)
* =SUMIF(B2:B12,<150)
* **=SUMIF(B2:B12,">150")**

> To add together only the values from Column B that cost more than $100, the correct syntax is =SUMIF(B2:B12,">150"). B2:B12 is the range, and more than 150 (>150) is the criteria.
