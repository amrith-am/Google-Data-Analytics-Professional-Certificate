* [How to name files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files): this resource from Speaker Deck is a playful take on file naming. It includes several slides with tips and examples for how to accurately name lots of different types of files. You will learn why filenames should be both machine readable and human readable. 
* [File naming and structure](https://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=102546&p=930626#:~:text=File%20naming%20best%20practices%3A&text=File%20names%20should%20be%20short,date%20format%20ISO%208601%3A%20YYYYMMDD): this resource from the Princeton University Library provides an easy-to-scan list of best practices, considerations, and examples for developing file naming conventions.
* [Pivoting](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html): Consider this a starting point for tidying data through wide and long conversions. This web page is taken directly from tidyr package information at [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It explores the components of the pivot_longer and pivot_wider functions using specific details, examples, and definitions. 
* [CleanItUp 5: R-Ladies Sydney: Wide to Long to Wide toâ€¦PIVOT](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-5/): This resource gives you additional details about the pivot_longer and pivot_wider functions. The examples provided use interesting datasets to illustrate how to convert data from wide to long and back to wide. 
* [Plotting multiple variables](https://scc.ms.unimelb.edu.au/resources-list/simple-r-scripts-for-analysis/r-scripts): This resource explains how to visualize wide and long data, with ggplot2 to help tidy it. The focus is on using pivot_longer to restructure data and make similar plots of a number of variables at once. You can apply what you learn from the other resources here for a broader understanding of the pivot functions.
* [Bias function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/SimDesign/versions/2.2/topics/bias): This web page is a good starting point to learn about how the bias function in R can help you identify and manage bias in your analysis.
* [Data Science Ethics](https://datasciencebox.org/ethics.html): This online course provides slides, videos, and exercises to help you learn more about ethics in the world of data analytics. It includes information about data privacy, misrepresentation in data, and applying ethics to your visualizations.
