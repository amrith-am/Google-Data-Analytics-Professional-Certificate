## L3 Coding in R

&nbsp;

### Question 1

An analyst includes the following calculation in their R programming: `midyear_sales <- (quarter_1_sales + quarter_2_sales) - overhead_costs` Which variable will the total from this calculation be assigned to?

* **`midyear_sales`**
* `quarter_1_sales`
* `quarter_2_sales`
* `overhead_costs`

> The total from this calculation will be assigned to the variable midyear_sales. The assignment operator <- follows the variable mid_sales, so the value of the calculated total is assigned to this variable.

&nbsp;

### Question 2

An analyst is checking the value of the variable x using a logical operator, so they run the following code:

`x > 35 & x < 65`

Which values of x would return `TRUE` when the analyst runs the code? Select all that apply.

* 35
* **50**
* **60**
* 70

> The values 50 and 60 will return `TRUE` when the analyst runs the code `x > 35 & x < 65`. In this code, the logical operator & tells the server to return `TRUE` when the value of the variable is greater than 35 and less than 65.

### Question 3

Which of the following functions can analysts use to create conditional statements in their R programming? Select all that apply.

* `print()`
* **`else()`**
* **`if()`**
* `c()`

> Analysts can use the if() and else() functions and other functions to create conditional statements in their R programming. Conditional statements declare that if a certain condition is true, then a certain event must take place.
