## Resources

* [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf): RStudio’s cheat sheet is a great reference to use while working with ggplot2. It has tons of helpful information, including explanations of how to use geoms and examples of the different visualizations that you can create. 
* [Stats Education’s Introduction to R](http://statseducation.com/Introduction-to-R/modules/graphics/aesthetics/): This resource is a great way to learn the basics of ggplot2 and how to apply aesthetic attributes to your plots. You can return to this tutorial as you work more with ggplot2 and your own data. 
* [RDocumentation aes function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.3/topics/aes): This guide describes the syntax of the aes function and explains what each argument does. 
* [Putting it all together: (dplyr+ggplot)](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/03-vizwhiz-1/#1-4-putting-it-all-together-dplyr-ggplot): The RLadies of Sydney’s course on R uses real data to demonstrate R functions. This lesson focuses specifically on combining dplyr and ggplot to filter data before plotting it. The instructional video will guide you through every step in the process while you follow along with the data they have provided. 
* [Data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html): This resource focuses on how to use the filter() function in R, and demonstrates how to combine filter() with ggplot(). This is a useful resource if you are interested in learning more about how filter() can be used before plotting. 
* [Visualizing data with ggplot2](https://datacarpentry.org/dc_zurich/R-ecology/05-visualisation-ggplot2.html): This comprehensive guide includes everything from the most basic uses for ggplot2 to creating complicated visualizations. It includes the filter() function in most of the examples so you can learn how to implement it in R to create data visualizations.
* [Create an annotation layer](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html): This guide explains how to add an annotation layer with ggplot2. It includes sample code and data visualizations with annotations created in ggplot2. 
* [How to annotate a plot in ggplot2](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/233-add-annotations-on-ggplot2-chart.html): This resource includes explanations about how to add different kinds of annotations to your ggplot2 plots, and is a great reference if you need to quickly look up a specific kind of annotation. 
* [Annotations](https://ggplot2-book.org/annotations.html): Chapter eight of the online ggplot2 textbook is focused entirely on annotations. It provides in-depth explanations of the different types of annotations, how they are used, and detailed examples. 
* [How to annotate a plot](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/02/how-to-annotate-a-plot-in-ggplot2/): This R-Bloggers article includes explanations about how to annotate plots in ggplot2. It starts with basic concepts and covers more complicated information the further on you read. 
* [Text Annotations](https://viz-ggplot2.rsquaredacademy.com/textann.html): This resource focuses specifically on adding text annotations and labels to ggplot2 visualizations. 
* [Saving images without ggsave()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html#saving-images-without-ggsave-): This resource is pulled directly from the ggplot2 documentation at [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It explores the tools you can use to save images in R, and includes several examples to follow along with and learn how to save images in your own R workspace. 
* [How to save a ggplot](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/how-to-save-a-ggplot/): This resource covers multiple different methods for saving ggplots. It also includes copyable code with explanations about how each function is being used so that you can better understand each step in the process.
* [Saving a plot in R](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/saving-plot/): This guide covers multiple file formats that you can use to save your plots in R. Each section includes an example with an actual plot that you can copy and use for practice in your own R workspace.
