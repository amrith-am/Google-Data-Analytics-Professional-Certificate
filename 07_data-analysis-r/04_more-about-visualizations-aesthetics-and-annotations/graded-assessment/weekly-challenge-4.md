### Question 1

Which of the following are benefits of using ggplot2? Select all that apply. 

* Automatically clean data before creating a plot
* **Easily add layers to your plot** 
* **Combine data manipulation and visualization** 
* **Customize the look and feel of your plot** 

> The benefits of using ggplot2 include easily adding layers to your plot, customizing the look and feel of your plot, combining data manipulation and visualization.

&nbsp;

### Question 2

In ggplot2, what symbol do you use to add layers to your plot?

* The equal sign (=)
* The ampersand symbol (&)
* The pipe operator (%>%)
* **The plus sign (+)**

> In ggplot2, you use the plus sign (+) to add layers to your plot.

&nbsp;

### Question 3

A data analyst creates a plot using the following code chunk: 

```
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```

Which of the following represents a variable in the code chunk? Select all that apply. 

* **`body_mass_g`**
* `x`
* **`flipper_length_mm`**
* `y`

> The two variables in the code are flipper_length_mm and body_mass_g. The two variables are part of the penguins dataset. The aesthetic x maps the variable flipper_length_mm to the x-axis of the plot. The aesthetic y maps the variable body_mass_g to the y-axis of the plot.

&nbsp;

### Question 4

A data analyst uses the aes() function to define the connection between their data and the plots in their visualization. What argument is used to refer to matching up a specific variable in your data set with a specific aesthetic?

* Faceting 
* **Mapping** 
* Jittering
* Annotating 

> Mapping is an argument that matches up a specific variable in your data set with a specific aesthetic. You use the aes() function to define the mapping between your data and your plot. 

&nbsp;

### Question 5

A data analyst is working with the penguins data. The analyst creates a scatterplot with the following code: 

```
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,alpha = species))
```

What does the alpha aesthetic do to the appearance of the points on the plot? 

* **Makes some points on the plot more transparent**
* Makes the points on the plot more colorful 
* Makes the points on the plot smaller
* Makes the points on the plot larger 

> The alpha aesthetic makes some points on a plot more transparent, or see-through, than others.

&nbsp;

### Question 6

You are working with the penguins dataset. You create a scatterplot with the following code chunk: 

```
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
```

How do you change the second line of code to map the aesthetic size to the variable species? 

* `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, species = size)`
* **`geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, size = species))`**
* `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, species + size)`
* `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, size + species))`

> You change the second line of code to `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, size = species))` to map the aesthetic size to the variable species. Inside the parentheses of the aes() function, add a comma after y = body_mass_g to add a new aesthetic attribute, then write size = species to map the aesthetic size to the variable species. The data points for each of the three penguin species will now appear in different sizes.

### Question 7

Fill in the blank: The _____  creates a scatterplot and then adds a small amount of random noise to each point in the plot to make the points easier to find.

* geom_bar() function
* **geom_jitter() function**
* geom_smooth() function 
* geom_point() function

> The `geom_jitter()` function creates a scatterplot and then adds a small amount of random noise to each point in the plot to make the points easier to find.

&nbsp;

### Question 8

You have created a plot based on data in the diamonds dataset. What code chunk can be added to your existing plot to create wrap around facets based on the variable *color*? 

* **`facet_wrap(~color)`**
* `facet_wrap(color)`
* `facet_wrap(color~)`
* `facet(~color)`

> The code chunk is `facet_wrap(~color)`. Inside the parentheses of the facet_wrap() function, type a tilde symbol (~) followed by the name of the variable you want to facet. 

&nbsp;

### Question 9

A data analyst uses the annotate() function to create a text label for a plot. Which attributes of the text can the analyst change by adding code to the argument of the annotate() function? Select all that apply.

* **Change the size of the text**
* **Change the font style of the text**
* **Change the color of the text**
* Change the text into a title for the plot 

> By adding code to the argument of the annotate() function, the analyst can change the font style, color, and size of the text. 


&nbsp;

### Question 10

You are working with the penguins dataset. You create a scatterplot with the following lines of code:

```
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
```

What code chunk do you add to the third line to save your plot as a jpeg file with "penguins" as the file name?

* `ggsave(penguins)`
* `ggsave("penguins.jpeg")`
* `ggsave(penguins.jpeg)`
* `ggsave("jpeg.penguins")`

> You add the code chunk `ggsave("penguins.jpeg")` to save your plot as a jpeg file with "penguins" as the file name. Inside the parentheses of the ggsave() function, type a quotation mark followed by the file name (penguins), then a period, then the type of file (jpeg), then a closing quotation mark.
