# The importance of context

So far, you have learned that context is the condition in which something exists or happens. Context is important in data analytics because it helps us sift through huge amounts of disorganized data and turn it into something meaningful. The fact is, data has little value if it is not paired with context.

So understanding the context behind the data can help us make it more meaningful at every stage of the data analysis process. For example if we gave you the table below, you might be able to make a few guesses about what you are looking at but it wouldn’t make much sense. 

| 2010 | 28000 |
|------|-------|
| 2005 | 18000 |
| 2000 | 23000 |
| 1995 | 10000 |

But if we explained that the first column represented the years when a survey was conducted and the number of persons who responded were noted in the second column, then it starts to make a lot more sense. If we kept going and explained that the survey is conducted every 5 years as a part of the data collection process built into the design, you could then figure out why there are periodic gaps in the table. The information added provided context for the raw data that you were looking at. That context can easily be added to the table like this:

| Years (Collected every 5 years) | Respondents |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| 2010                            | 28000       |
| 2005                            | 18000       |
| 2000                            | 23000       |
| 1995                            | 10000       |

**Contextual information makes a big difference and it can turn raw data into meaningful information**. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

* When the data was created or collected
* How it was created or collected
* Where it came from
* Who funded the collection, if that is the case
* The motivation behind the collection
* The other things in the world that data could have an impact on

Understanding and including the context is important during each step of your analysis process, so it is a good idea to get comfortable with it early in your career.

For example, when you collect data, you’ll also want to ask questions about the context to make sure that you understand the business and business process. During organization, the context is important for your naming conventions, how you choose to show relationships between variables, and what you choose to keep or leave out. And finally, when you present, it is important to include contextual information so that your stakeholders understand what they have.

Without context, data isn’t actually meaningful. Understanding the context behind the data shapes your analysis process at every stage; so ask questions about your data early on and use it to help make your data useful and meaningful to your stakeholders.
