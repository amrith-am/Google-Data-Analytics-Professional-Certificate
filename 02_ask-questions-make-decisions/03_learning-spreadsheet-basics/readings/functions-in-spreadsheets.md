# Quick reference: Functions in spreadsheets

Here is a reference guide for spreadsheet functions that you can use when you are working with spreadsheets on your own. 

As a quick refresher, a function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet. Functions give data analysts the ability to do calculations, which can be anything from simple arithmetic to complex equations. Use this reading to help you keep track of some of the most useful options.
Functions

&nbsp;

## The basics

* Just like formulas, start all of your functions with an equal sign (=SUM). The equal sign tells the spreadsheet that what follows is part of a function, not just a word or number in a cell. 
* After you type the equal sign, most spreadsheet applications will display an autocomplete menu that lists valid functions, names, and text strings. This is a great way to create and edit functions while avoiding typing and syntax errors.
* A fun way to learn new functions is by simply typing an equal sign and a single letter of the alphabet. Choose one of the options that pops up and learn what that function does.

## Difference between formulas and functions

* A formula is a statement written by the user within a spreadsheet application.
* A function is a predefined operation built into the spreadsheet application.

## Popular functions

A lot of people don’t realize that keyboard shortcuts like cut, save, and find are actually functions. These functions are built into an application and are amazing time-savers. Using shortcuts lets you do more with less effort. They can make you more efficient and productive because you are not constantly reaching for the mouse and navigating menus. The following table shows some of the most popular shortcuts, for Chromebook, PC, and Mac:

| Command                    | Chromebook                             | PC                                                           | Mac                       |

## Copying

* Drag the cell across and/or down to copy the function.
* Double-click the small blue dot in the bottom right corner of a highlighted cell to copy a function through an entire column.

&nbsp;

## Absolute referencing

* Relative references will change anytime the function is copied and pasted. They are in relation to where the referenced cell is located.
* Absolute references will not change when you copy and paste the function in a different cell. The cell being referenced is always the same.
* In many spreadsheet applications, you can press the F4 key to toggle between relative and absolute references in ranges in your functions.

&nbsp;

## Data range

* When you click into your function, the colored ranges indicate which cells are being used in your spreadsheet. There are different colors for each unique range in your function.
* Data ranges help keep you from getting lost in complex functions.
* In many spreadsheet applications, you can press the F2 key to highlight the range of data in a function. Click in to edit the cell, then click on the range of data in your function, then press F2. It will highlight the range of data for you.

&nbsp;

## Combining with formulas

* COUNTIF() is the combination of a formula and a function. This allows the function to run based on a criteria set by the formula.
