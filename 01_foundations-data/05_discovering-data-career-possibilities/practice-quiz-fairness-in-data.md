### Question 2

Avens Engineering needs more engineers, so they purchase ads on a job search website. The website’s data reveals that 86% of engineers are men. Based on that number, an analyst decides that men are more likely to be successful applicants, so they target the ads to male job seekers. What should the analyst have done instead?

* **Make sure their recommendation doesn’t create or reinforce bias**
* Decline to accept ads from Avens Engineering because of fairness concerns.
* Let Avens Engineering decide which type of applicants to target ads to.
* Only show ads for the engineering jobs to women.

> They should make sure their recommendation doesn't create or reinforce bias. As a data analyst, it’s important to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.

### Question 3

A data analyst working on a project related to truck-driver safety discovers that all reported accidents involve male drivers. What is their best course of action?

* Disregard accidents that weren’t caused by driver error. 
* **Take a closer look at the social context of their conclusion.** 
* Analyze the safety data for other types of drivers.
* Create a report to share the results with project stakeholders.

> The analyst should take a closer look at the social context of their conclusion. Males represent a larger proportion of truck drivers, so the social context will be important to their project.

### Question 4

On a railway line, peak ridership occurs between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM. The fairness of a passenger survey could be improved by over-sampling data from which group?

* **Nighttime riders**
* Daytime riders
* Male passengers 
* Female passengers

> Over-sampling the data from nighttime riders, an under-represented group of passengers, could improve the fairness of the survey.

### Question 5

A real estate company needs to hire a human resources assistant. The owner asks a data analyst to help them decide where to advertise the job opening. The analyst learns that the majority of human resources professionals are women, validates this finding with research, and targets ads to a women's community college. This is fair because the analyst conducted research to make sure the information about gender breakdown of human resources professionals was accurate.

* True
* **False**

> This is not fair. Fairness means ensuring that analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. As a data analyst, it’s important to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.
