I use `dplyr` when I'm cleaning and exploring my dataset, and what I particularly love is that after I get a good handle on my dataset with `dplyr`, I can feed the various manipulations I've creating into the `ggplot2` package for visualization.  \n\nThis tutorial is for anyone interested in learning the basics of the `dplyr` package. We'll be focusing on data exploration and manipulation, building off of the examples in the `dplyr` package documentation using the [Palmer Penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) dataset.   \n\n**By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:**  \n* Demonstrate what each of the main five `dplyr` functions does\n* Use the pipe operator `%>%` to chain together multiple `dplyr` functions"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### My analytical workflow\n\nWe won't be covering _all_ of the steps in my workflow in this tutorial, but in general I follow these steps: \n\n1.

In our conflicts we see that the `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package masks the `filter()` function from the `stats` package. We know this because the package name comes before the double colon and the function name comes after, like this:  \n\n> `package::function()`\n\nWhat if we want to use the `filter()` function from the stats package?

The `read_csv()` function looks at the first thousand rows of a dataset and makes an educated guess as to what the remaining rows are.
