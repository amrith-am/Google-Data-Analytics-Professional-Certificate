### Best practices for file naming conventions

* Work out conventions to use early on to avoid having to rename files again and again.
* Align your file naming with your team or company's existing file-naming conventions.
* Make sure that your file name is meaningful; include information like project name, date created, revision version, and anything else that will help you quickly identify (and sue) your file.
* Include the date and version of the file in the name; common formats for this inclide YYYYMMDD and v## for versions.
* Create a text file with a breakdown of the file naming conventions you've decided to use.
* Avoid spaces and specials characters i.e #,$,@,etc. Instead, use hypens, underscores, or capital letters. Special characters or spaces can create errors in some programs.

### Best practices for keeping your files organized

* Create folders and subfolders hierarchically so that related files are stored together.
* Separated ongoing and completed work so that your current project file are easy to find. You can archive older project files in a separated folder location or an external hard drive.
* Backup your files often to avoid losing any important work.
