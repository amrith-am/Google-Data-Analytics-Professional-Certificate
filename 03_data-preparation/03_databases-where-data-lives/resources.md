## Exploring public datasets resources

In this reading, you will find a list of open datasets to work with on your own. So far, you have learned about open data that is available for anyone to access, use, and share. [Open data](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets) gets used a lot to create **public datasets** that you can access to help companies make insights and decisions. Or, you can use public data sets to practice on your own! You can even publish your work with public datasets and share your findings with other people. Just remember to always cite your sources. 

&nbsp;

### Finding public datasets 

Here are some resources you can use to start searching for public datasets on your own:

* The [Google Cloud Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets) allow data analysts access to high-demand public datasets, and make it easy to uncover insights in the cloud. 
* The [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) can help you find available datasets online with keyword searches. 
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google.com+search&utm_campaign=datasets&gclid=CjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-L6PpACh6RzmrJjQjmNGCCE7kky1FCtc6Jf1qld-4NwDMYL0WsUyxBoCdwAQAvD_BwE) has an Open Data search function that can help you find datasets to practice with.
Finally, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) hosts 150+ public datasets you can access and use. 

Whichever public datasets you end up using in your role as a data analyst, one thing is for sure: they all can help you find the information you need and make strong arguments for your case.
